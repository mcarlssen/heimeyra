## KNOWN ISSUES
- Setting isPaused to false sometimes doesn't resume the backend, resulting in a data.filter error.
  The frontend continues to cycle, resulting in stale data. When isPaused is toggled
  from true -> false, AircraftList should be cleared and re-rendered.

## FEATURES TODO
- Add crosshairs to map
- add sentry/bugsnag logging
- add readme.md
