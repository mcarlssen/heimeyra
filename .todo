## BUGS
- Setting isPaused to false sometimes doesn't resume the backend, resulting in a data.filter error.
  The frontend continues to cycle, resulting in stale data. When isPaused is toggled
  from true -> false, AircraftList should be cleared and re-rendered.

## FEATURES
- Add crosshairs to map
- add "howto" readme that pops if it's the user's first visit
- update 'about' and 'help' text
- change the lat/long text boxes to use MaterialUi Text Field
