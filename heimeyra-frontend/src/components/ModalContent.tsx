        <p><b><i>heimeyra</i> loosely means "home of listening" in Old Norse.</b> According to legend, Heimdall could hear grass grow...but heimdall.app was taken. heimerya was built by audiobook narrator and voice actor <a href="https://magnuscarlssen.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnus Carlssen</a>.</p>
        <p>I live near a small university flight school, and am frequently interrupted during recording sessions by trainers buzzing my studio. To avoid losing a perfect take, I use public aircraft tracking data to watch out for incoming aircraft.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/mcarlssen/code/tree/main/plane-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first generation of this app</a> in 2023 was a simple Powershell script. I rebuilt it as a webapp in the fall of 2024 to teach myself Typescript, React, and Cursor.</p>
        <p>If you find it useful, or want to commiserate about the joys of recording audiobooks near an airfield (looking at you, Duffy), join us in the <a href="https://dsc.gg/narrators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audiobook Producers Discord</a>. We're a friendly, quiet bunch, and don't much like airplanes.</p>
